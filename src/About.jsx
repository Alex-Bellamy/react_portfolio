        <p> I have always been fascinated and sometimes perplexed by coding and the tech sector. Ever innovative products being developed, changing everyday lives and how this has become engrained into all industries, professions and government authorities. I never had the time to fully submerge myself in it given the demands of my career and other ventures. Having emigrated to my wife’s native Sweden it was a perfect time to pursue such a dream.</p>
        <p>Whilst in the UK I assisted struggling businesses and individuals. I developed a range of skills given the work was extremely varied which included preparing documentation to initiate formal procedures, liaising with numerous government departments, preparing reports adapted to different audiences including technical situations to laypeople, preparing tax returns to trading businesses across various industries including managing their day to day operations… Forging a career in this industry was very fulfilling but given it was finance based I was unable to release my creative side. Web development has allowed me to facilitate this :).</p>
        <p>I am highly motivated and a self-starter having studied tough and time consuming professional qualifications, at high tempo, whilst in full time employment. I was thrown straight into the deep end when I started my UK career growing rapidly and adapting to every challenge. I excelled through on the job work experience, and hands-on learning working in teams. I relish working alongside likeminded individuals, am keen to learn from others as well as share ideas and skills.</p>
        <p>[Details about my Craft Academy and tech experience to be entered when the course has advanced]</p>
        <p>On a more personal level, I enjoy traveling and hiking. I am also keen on DIY (do it yourself) and love a challenge. My wife and I have recently renovated a mid-terrace property in Greater London. Again, keen to do everything to the best of my ability I attained an intense, fast tracked training and a City and Guilds qualification in construction skills.</p>
        <p>I was a sergeant in the Air Training Corps (“ATC” - youth UK Royal Air Force). Whilst at the ATC, I completed a gruelling 100-mile (160km) march in the Netherlands with the ATC to receive the Internationale Vierdaagse Afstandsmarsen royal medal and was awarded a private pilot’s scholarship as a result of my confident solo flying.</p>
        <p>I regard myself as extremely motivated, setting high expectations for myself and I am prepared to put in the hard work in order to succeed.</p>
